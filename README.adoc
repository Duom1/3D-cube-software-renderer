== What is this?

This is a c program written by me that renders a spinning cube
in perspective. The desktop version uses raylib to to draw the
graphics and the m5stack uses the m5stack libraries to draw the
graphics. There is a simple Makefile that can be used to compile
for the desktop. And for the m5 version uses platformio as the
build system.
